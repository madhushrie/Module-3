# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
same as this one 
```
tuplex = ("S", 89, "R", "e", "s", "o", "u", "r", "c", "e","D")
print("r" in tuplex)
print("5" in tuplex)
```
## Output

## Result
Thus the program is executed successfully.
